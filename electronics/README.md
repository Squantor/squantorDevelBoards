# Development board electronics
Stored here is the electronics for various development boards I use. Most are based on the "nuclone" principle. They look a lot like the STM32 nucleo series development boards.
## List of boards
* [nuclone board for the LPC804M101JHI33](nuclone_LPC804M101JHI33/README.md) is a breakout for the LPC804M101JHI33 microcontroller.
* [nuclone board for the LPC812M101JDH20](nuclone_LPC812M101JDH20/README.md) is a breakout for the LPC812M101JDH20 microcontroller.
* [nuclone board for the LPC824M201JDH20](nuclone_LPC824M201JDH20/README.md) is a breakout for the LPC824M201JDH20 microcontroller.
