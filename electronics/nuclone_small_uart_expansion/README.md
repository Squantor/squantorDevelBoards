# Nuclone UART, JST expansion board
Nuclone expansion board with UART, prototyping area and some connections
# HSI (Hardware Software Interface)
No real HSI to speak about.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* Review with one night in between
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/)
* Assemble
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
## BOM
This is a list of hardware components. If just mentioned a generic component like a 1K 0402 resistor, just name it as such, free to substitute. If you need some special integrated IC's show some sources like Mouser, Digikey, Farnell, or LCSC
* CH340B USB to serial converter
